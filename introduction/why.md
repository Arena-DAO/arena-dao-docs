# Why create the Arena DAO?

### 1. Bridging Trust in Competition Payouts

**The Problem:** In traditional competitions, participants often face the risk of non-payment or disputes.

**Arena DAO's Solution:** Our platform implements a trustless competition workflow:

* Users can set expiration times for competitions
* Disputes trigger a "jailed" state
* Arena DAO acts as a neutral mediator, reviewing evidence to ensure fair outcomes

### 2. Enhancing Financial Security

**The Problem:** Centralized systems in traditional platforms pose security risks and often involve high fees and withdrawal limits.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Use of blockchain tokens for all transactions
* Funds remain in user control unless in competition escrow
* Minimal platform fees to support the ecosystem
* Leveraging Neutron's low gas fees for cost-efficiency

### 3. Simplifying Prize Distributions

**The Problem:** Manual management of team payouts is tedious and error-prone.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Automated preset distributions
* Direct allocation of winnings to members' escrow balances
* Quick and fair payouts for all team members

### 4. Empowering Sovereign Competitive Organizations

**The Problem:** Traditional competitive organizations often lack autonomy, stifling innovation and reducing stakeholder engagement.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Decentralized governance allowing organizations to operate as independent entities
* Custom tokenomics for unique engagement and revenue models
* Stakeholder involvement in decision-making processes
* Transparent operations and financial transactions
* Inter-organization collaborations without centralized approval

### 5. Providing Open-Source Infrastructure

**The Problem:** The competitive industry lacks open-source infrastructure, stifling innovation.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Open-source smart contracts for modular competition frameworks
* Arena Core and Competition Modules for custom rules and formats
* Fostering an innovative ecosystem for community contributions
