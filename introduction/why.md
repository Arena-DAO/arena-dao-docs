# Why create the Arena DAO?

Arena DAO was created to address key challenges in online competitions and decentralized organizations. Here's how we're revolutionizing the space:

### 1. Bridging Trust in Competition Payouts

**The Problem:** In traditional online competitions, participants often face the risk of non-payment or disputes.

**Arena DAO's Solution:** Our platform implements a trustless competition workflow:

* Users can set expiration times for competitions
* Disputes trigger a "jailed" state
* Arena DAO acts as a neutral mediator, reviewing evidence to ensure fair outcomes

### 2. Enhancing Financial Security

**The Problem:** Centralized credit systems in traditional platforms pose security risks and often involve high fees and withdrawal limits.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Use of blockchain tokens for all transactions
* Funds remain in user control unless in competition escrow
* Minimal platform fees to support the ecosystem
* Leveraging Neutron's low gas fees for cost-efficiency

### 3. Simplifying Prize Distributions

**The Problem:** Manual management of team payouts is tedious and error-prone.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Automated preset distributions
* Direct allocation of winnings to members' escrow balances
* Quick and fair payouts for all team members

### 4. Democratizing Competitive Organizations

**The Problem:** Traditional organizations often suffer from power imbalances and lack of transparency.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Decentralized governance giving every participant ownership
* Stakeholder involvement for hosts, players, teams, and fans
* Aligned interests and transparent decision-making

### 5. Providing Open-Source Infrastructure

**The Problem:** The eSports industry lacks open-source infrastructure, stifling innovation.

**Arena DAO's Solution:**

* Open-source smart contracts for modular competition frameworks
* Arena Core and Competition Modules for custom rules and formats
* Fostering an innovative ecosystem for community contributions

By addressing these key issues, Arena DAO is set to transform the landscape of online competitions and decentralized organizations.
