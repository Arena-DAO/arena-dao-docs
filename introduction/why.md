# Why create the Arena DAO?

### Bridging Trust

Users shouldn’t have to rely on trust for competition payouts. Imagine playing an online chess match with someone across the globe, only for your opponent to disconnect upon losing. With Arena DAO, this risk is eliminated.&#x20;

**Arena DAO's Solution:** Our [competition workflow](../the-arena-core/competitions/) allows users to set an expiration time for competitions, after which they can be "jailed." In this state, Arena DAO acts as a neutral mediator, reviewing evidence from both parties to ensure a fair outcome.

### **Fixing Centralized Issues**

Traditional competition platforms use centralized credit systems, posing security risks and vulnerabilities. These systems are prime targets for hacks and often involve processing fees and withdrawal limits.&#x20;

**Arena DAO's Solution:** Arena DAO uses blockchain tokens for all transactions, ensuring your coins remain yours unless they’re in competition escrow. We charge a minimal [platform fee](../the-arena-core/tax.md) to support the ecosystem. With Neutron's low gas fees, we offer a cost-efficient solution for competitors.

### Simplifying Distributions

Managing team payouts manually is tedious and error-prone. As a team member, you might worry about timely and fair distribution of prize money.&#x20;

**Arena DAO's Solution:** With [preset distributions](../the-arena-core/escrow.md), teams can automate the allocation of competition winnings directly to members' escrow balances, ensuring quick and fair payouts.

### **Transforming Competitive Organizations**

Traditional competitive organizations often suffer from power imbalances and lack of transparency, leaving players and teams with little influence over management decisions.&#x20;

**Arena DAO's Solution:** Arena DAO empowers every participant with ownership through [decentralized governance](https://docs.daodao.zone/introduction/whats-a-dao). Whether you're a host, player, team, or fan, you have a stake in the organization. This ensures aligned interests and transparent decision-making.

### **A Lack of Open-Source Infrastructure**

The eSports industry lacks open-source infrastructure, relying heavily on proprietary software that stifles innovation and flexibility.&#x20;

**Arena DAO's Solution:** Arena DAO champions open-source principles by offering modular competition frameworks through open-source smart contracts. Our [Arena Core](broken-reference) and Competition Modules enable participants to create custom rules, implement unique reward structures, and organize new competitive formats. This fosters an innovative ecosystem where contributors can easily build, share, and enhance each other’s work.
