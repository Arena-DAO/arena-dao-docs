# How to get started?

This guide will walk you through the process of joining our decentralized platform, from setting up your wallet to participating in competitions and governance. Let's get you ready for the Arena!

### Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

To interact with Arena DAO, you'll need a wallet compatible with the Cosmos ecosystem. We recommend:

### Step 2: Acquire Cryptocurrency

To participate in Arena DAO, you'll need cryptocurrency. Here are two ways to get started:

#### Option A: Purchase via a Centralized Exchange (CEX)

1. Create an account on a CEX like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/).
2. Purchase USDC, ATOM, or other supported tokens.
3. Withdraw your purchased tokens to your wallet address (see Step 3).

#### Option B: Use a Fiat On-ramp Service

Kado allows you to buy or sell digital assets instantly using your credit card or bank account. Follow their instructions to purchase supported tokens directly to your wallet.

#### Withdraw from CEX

1. In your CEX account, go to the withdrawals section.
2. Choose your cryptocurrency and enter your wallet address as the recipient.
3. For USDC, make sure to withdraw to the Noble network.
4. Confirm the withdrawal and wait for the transaction to complete.
