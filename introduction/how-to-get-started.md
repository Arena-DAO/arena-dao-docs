# How to get started?

This guide will walk you through joining Arena DAO, from setting up your wallet to getting cryptocurrency, so you can dive into decentralized competitions with ease.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

To get started, you'll need a wallet that supports the Cosmos ecosystem. Here are two easy-to-use options:

### Step 2: Buy Cryptocurrency (On-Ramp)

To participate in Arena DAO, you need cryptocurrency. Below are two options for acquiring the correct tokens.

#### Option A: Use a Centralized Exchange (CEX)

1. **Sign up** for a trusted exchange like [**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/), [**Binance**](https://www.binance.com/), or [**Kraken**](https://www.kraken.com/).
2. **Buy the Correct Cryptocurrency**
   * **For USDC**:
     * Purchase **USDC** (USD Coin), a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar.
     * **Important**: Ensure the exchange allows withdrawals of USDC on the **Noble network**. If not, consider buying **NTRN** or **ATOM** instead.
   * **For NTRN:**
     * Buy **NTRN**, the native token of the Neutron network.
   * **For ATOM**:
     * Buy **ATOM**, the native token of the Cosmos network, which is widely supported.
3. **Withdraw Tokens to Your Wallet Address**
   1. **Access the Withdrawal Section**:
      * Navigate to the **"Withdraw"** or **"Send"** section of the exchange.
   2. **Enter Your Wallet Address**:
      * Open your Keplr or Leap wallet to copy your **wallet address**.
      * Paste it into the withdrawal form on the exchange.
   3. **Select the Correct Network**:
      * For **USDC**:
        * Choose the **Noble network** as the withdrawal network.
        * **Note**: USDC exists on multiple networks (like Ethereum and Solana). It's crucial to select **Noble** to ensure compatibility.
      * For **NTRN:**
        * Select the **Neutron network**.
      * For **ATOM**:
        * Select the **Cosmos Hub network**.
   4. **Confirm the Withdrawal**:
      * Double-check all details.
      * Confirm and submit the withdrawal request.
      * Wait for the transaction to complete (may take a few minutes).

#### Option B: Use an On-ramp Service

These services allow you to purchase cryptocurrency directly with your bank account or credit card into our Keplr or Leap wallet.

* [**Kado**](https://www.kado.money/):
  * Visit the Kado website.
  * Choose **USDC** or **ATOM**.
  * Enter your Neutron or Cosmos wallet address.
  * Complete the purchase using your credit card or bank transfer.
* [**Monerium**](https://monerium.com/) (For European Users):
  * Sign up on Monerium.
  * Purchase **EURe**.
  * Provide your Neutron wallet address for direct transfer.

### Step 3: Transfer Funds to the Neutron Network (if your assets are not already on Neutron)

If you’ve acquired tokens like **USDC**, **ATOM**, or **EURe** but they are not yet on the **Neutron network**, you will need to bridge them over. Use one of the following bridging solutions:

### Step 4: Establish a Team via DAO DAO (Optional)

If you're interested in forming a team to participate in competitions and make use of automatic distributions, you can set up a team using **DAO DAO**, which helps you create and manage decentralized organizations.

**How to Set Up a Team:**

1. **Visit the DAO DAO Platform**:
   * Go to [**DAO DAO**](https://daodao.zone/).
2. **Create a New DAO**:
   * Click on **Create** and follow the instructions to establish your team.
   * This will guide you through the process of naming your DAO, setting up governance rules, and adding members.
   * Your DAO's address will be available in the URL of your DAO page.
3. **Use the Apps Tab**:
   * Once your DAO is created, navigate to the **Apps** tab on your DAO's page to perform actions through your DAO on other sites (step 5).
