# How to get started?

This guide will walk you through the steps to join and participate in our decentralized platform, from creating your wallet to bridging funds. Let's get you set up and ready to engage in exciting competitions and collaborative governance.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

To interact with the Arena DAO, you will need a wallet compatible with the Cosmos ecosystem. You can choose from several options:\

### Step 2: Purchase Cryptocurrency via a Centralized Exchange (CEX)

Before you can participate in competitions, you'll need some cryptocurrency. You can purchase assets like USDC, ATOM, or other tokens on a centralized exchange (CEX) such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. Alternatively, you can onramp with a service like Kado.

### Step 3: Transfer Funds

After purchasing your cryptocurrency, the next step is to transfer the funds to your wallet on the Neutron network.

* **Withdraw Funds**: In your CEX account, go to the withdrawal section, choose the cryptocurrency you bought, and send it to your wallet’s address. For USDC, you'll want to withdraw to Noble.
* **Bridge Funds:** Once the assets are under your control, we want to have them accessible on the Neutron network, so we can use one of many bridging solutions:
