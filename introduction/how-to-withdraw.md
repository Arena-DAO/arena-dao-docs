# How to withdraw?

This guide will help you convert your cryptocurrency on the **Neutron network** into fiat currency that can be withdrawn to your bank or spent through services like **Cypher Card**.

### Step 1: Transfer Assets to the Noble Network

The first step is to move your assets like from Neutron to a network compatible with off-ramping, such as the **Noble** network or **Osmosis**.

### Step 2: Off-Ramp

Now that your assets are on the correct network, you can choose between two off-ramping options:

#### **Option A: Withdraw to a Centralized Exchange (CEX)**

This option allows you to transfer your **USDC** or **EURe** from Noble or Osmosis to a centralized exchange and withdraw it to your bank.

1. **Choose Your Exchange**:
   * Supported exchanges include **Coinbase**, **Kraken**, or **Binance**.
2. **Get Your Deposit Address**:
   * Log in to your exchange and find the **Deposit** section.
   * Select **USDC** and make sure the deposit network is **Noble** or **Osmosis**.
   * Copy the deposit address.
3. **Transfer from Noble or Osmosis**:
   * In your Keplr or Leap wallet, go to **Send** or **Withdraw**.
   * Enter the CEX deposit address you copied and confirm the transaction.
4. **Convert to Fiat**:
   * Once the tokens arrive in your CEX account, swap them for fiat currency (e.g., USD or EUR).
5. **Withdraw to Your Bank**:
   * Go to the **Withdraw** section, select your bank account as the destination, and confirm.

#### Option B: Monerium for EURe

**Monerium** provides a seamless way for European users to withdraw funds in the form of **EURe**, a regulated, blockchain-based euro token.

1. **Create a Monerium Account**
   * Visit [https://monerium.app/](https://monerium.app/) and sign up for an account.
   * Complete the **KYC (Know Your Customer)** verification process as required.
2. **Connect Your Wallet**
   * Link your blockchain wallet to your Monerium account.
3. **Withdraw to Your Bank Account**
   * After your EURe deposit is confirmed, initiate a withdrawal to your **European bank account** (SEPA zone).
   * Monerium will handle the conversion of EURe to euros and deposit the funds directly to your bank account.

#### **Option C: Spend Using Cypher Card**

You can also load your **USDC** or **EURe** onto a **Cypher Card** to spend it directly.

1. **Sign Up for Cypher Card**:
   * Visit [**Cypher Card**](https://cyphercard.io/) and create an account. Referral code: **ARENADAO1**
