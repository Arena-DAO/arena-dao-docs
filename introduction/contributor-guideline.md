# Contributor Guideline

**How to Contribute**

Contributors are the backbone of Arena DAO, and there are many ways to get involved in this movement:

1. **Development**: Help develop and refine our smart contracts and interfaces. Familiarize yourself with our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Arena-DAO).
2. **Testing and Feedback**: Participate in testing phases, provide feedback on UX/UI, and suggest improvements.
3. **Community Growth**: Engage with the community on social media, write posts, or host demos. Help us start some partnerships!
4. **Representation**: Be recognized for your skills and knowledge in competitive gaming. Join our Arena eSports subDAO's to help shape the influence of the Arena DAO in your community.
5. **Content Creation:** Support the DAO and fellow community members with graphic design and video creation.

**Compensation and Incentives**

1. **Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC)**: Initially, most incentivization will come from the [ABC](../tokenomics/augmented-bonding-curve.md). Contributors will be the first to buy into the token through our sub-DAO's: Arena DAO Hatchers and Arena eSports. Taking on a more critical role can allow you to earn more buying power and earlier buying opportunity in the hatch phase without fees.
2. **Pending Grant Funding**: We are hopeful to secure funding from Neutron Grants. If successful, this will help us allocate a budget for critical developments and community initiatives, including direct compensation for key roles.
3. **Retroactive Compensation**: As the DAO profits, it may offer retroactive compensation from the treasury to contributors who have significantly impacted its growth.
4. **Token Buybacks**: Profits may be used to buy its own DAO token as a reserve.
5. **Liquidity Mining Incentives:** Profits may be used to [incentivize liquidity](../tokenomics/augmented-bonding-curve.md) on an AMM.
