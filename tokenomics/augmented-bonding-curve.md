# Augmented Bonding Curve

An Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) is an advanced financial mechanism used in decentralized finance (DeFi) to create and manage sustainable token economies. It builds upon traditional bonding curves, incorporating additional features to ensure a more robust and balanced ecosystem.

### Arena DAO's Transition to ABC

#### Initial Phase: Membership-Based DAO

Arena DAO will start as a membership-based organization, focusing on building a strong community foundation and establishing decentralized governance frameworks.

#### Transition: Token-Based Model

As we grow, we'll transition to a token-based model using the ABC, which will automate token supply management and align incentives between the DAO and early contributors.

### ABC Configuration for Arena DAO

* **Token:** ARENA
* **Total Supply:** 100,000,000 tokens
* **Pricing Model:** Square-root curve with USDC
* **Liquidity:** Established during the hatch phase as protocol-owned liquidity

### Token Distribution

1. Founder: 21,544,347 tokens (21.54%)
2. Contributor Space: 6,686,734 tokens (6.69%)
3. Arena Gladiators: 10,388,495 tokens (10.39%)
4. Arena Liquidity: 5,192,988 tokens (5.19%)
5. Investors: 9,567,170 tokens (9.57%)
6. Open Phase Mint: 46,620,266 tokens (46.62%)

### Phases of the ABC

#### 1. Hatch Phase

Purpose: Bootstrap initial funding, token distribution, and establish liquidity

* **Total Allocation:** 53,379,734 tokens (53.38% of total supply)
* **Participants:** Founder, Contributors, Arena Gladiators, Investors
* **Exclusivity:** Only approved contributors can participate
* **Liquidity Establishment:** Protocol-owned liquidity is set up during this phase

#### 2. Open Phase

* **Available for Minting:** 46,620,266 tokens (46.62% of total supply)
* **Entry Fee:** 99.999% (directly funds DAO treasury)
* **Exit Fee:** None

#### 3. Closed Phase (Future Consideration)

* Allows only selling of tokens into the curve
* Potential complete liquidation mechanism (not currently on roadmap)
