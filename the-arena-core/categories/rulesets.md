# Rulesets

Rulesets are pre-defined collections of rules and guidelines that streamline the competition creation process within the Arena DAO. By establishing a clear set of rules, rulesets ensure that all participants have a common understanding of the competition's structure and expectations.

### How Rulesets Work

Rulesets are organized by category to provide a tailored experience for each type of competition. Each category has its own set of rulesets, which define how competitions within that category should be conducted. Rulesets can only be added or disabled by the DAO, ensuring a secure and transparent process.
