# Tournaments

The Arena Tournament Module is an advanced implementation of a competition module within the Arena ecosystem. It enables the creation and management of elimination-style tournaments, offering both single and double elimination formats.

## Key Components

### 1. Tournament Management

### a. Host

* **Options**:
  * Assign a specific referee (individual account).
  * Designate a pre-created DAO (e.g., a referee DAO).
* **Role**: Manages the tournament, inputs match results, and oversees the event progression.

### b. Configuration

* **Name**: Unique identifier for the tournament.
* **Description**: Comprehensive overview of the tournament.
* **Banner**: Optional image representation.
* **Expiration**: Defines the end point (time, block height, or never).
  * Note: If not processed by expiration, the tournament can be "jailed" and resolved only by the Arena DAO.
* **Rules**: Guidelines governing the tournament.
* **Rulesets**: Pre-defined sets of rules that can be applied if available for the tournament's category.

### 2. Financial Management

Dues

* Define stakes or entry fees for the tournament.
* Specify funding sources and amounts.
* For detailed information about dues handling, refer to the Escrow page.

### 3. Tournament-Specific Parameters

#### a. Elimination Type

Choose from the following options:

* Single Elimination without Third Place Match
* Single Elimination with Third Place Match
* Double Elimination

#### b. Teams

* List of participating teams or individuals in the tournament, ordered by seeding.

#### c. Distribution

* Defines how the prize pool will be distributed among final placements.

#### 4. Stat Tracking

* **Performance Metrics**: Track key indicators for participants (e.g., wins, losses, round reached).
* **Bracket Visualization**: Real-time display of the tournament bracket and progression.
* **Historical Data**: Maintain records of past tournaments, matches, and outcomes.
* **Achievements**: Award recognitions for outstanding performances or milestones.
* **Data Visualization**: Present stats in easily digestible formats (graphs, charts).

## How It Works

1. **Tournament Setup**
   * Organizers define standard competition details, list of seeded participants, elimination type, and prize distribution.
   * The module automatically generates the tournament bracket based on the chosen elimination type and number of participants.
2. **Bracket Generation**
   * An optimal algorithm is used to create the tournament bracket.
   * The algorithm gives preference to higher-seeded teams, ensuring a fair and competitive structure.
3. **Match Management**
   * As each match concludes, the host inputs results into the system.
   * The bracket is dynamically updated, and the next round of matches is automatically determined.
4. **Tournament Progression**
   * Single Elimination: Losers are eliminated, winners progress to the next round.
   * Double Elimination: Losers move to a "losers' bracket" for a second chance, winners continue in the "winners' bracket". A rebuttal match will be played if the loser's bracket winner beats the winners' bracket winner.
5. **End of Tournament Processing**
   * When all matches are completed, the module determines the final placements.
   * Prize funds are automatically distributed based on the predefined distribution.
