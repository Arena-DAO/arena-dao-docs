# What is the Arena DAO?

### A Decentralized Competition Platform and DAO

The concept of the Arena DAO originated as a trustless, peer-to-peer competition platform. Our vision was to empower people to compete without worrying about non-payers or distribution problems. To achieve this, we required an arbiter that could provide impartial oversight. Thus, the Arena DAO was born. By merging decentralized governance with an innovative competition platform, the Arena DAO offers a seamless solution for competitive communities.

### A Partnership Network

The Arena DAO will act as a bridge between sponsors, brands, and competitors. Through strategic partnerships and sponsorship opportunities, we aim to create a win-win ecosystem that benefits players, teams, and partners alike. This network ensures sustainable growth and resource availability for its ecosystems, forging strong relationships that drive the future of competition. Our partnerships enable us to offer attractive incentives, increased visibility, and enhanced resources to all stakeholders.

### **A Multi-Title eSports Organization**

The Arena DAO oversees Arena eSports, which comprises multiple subDAOs, each dedicated to a specific eSports title. These subDAOs function as influential bodies within their respective gaming communities, guiding Arena DAOâ€™s strategic initiatives in the eSports sector. Members of each subDAO play significant roles in voting on future plans, allocating funding for events, and shaping the outreach and development of their communities. This structure ensures that the Arena eSports division supports its members' endeavors and empowers them to influence the growth and direction of the eSports industry through thoughtful governance and community engagement.
