# Token Gateway

The Arena Token Gateway serves as an important tool for onboarding key members into the DAO, managing the community-driven application process and token distribution through vesting. This contract enables the DAO to carefully curate the influx of new talent while fostering long-term commitment and alignment with the DAO's vision.

### Key Features

* **Streamlined Application Process**: Easy submission and management of DAO membership applications.
* **Fair Review System**: Applications are reviewed through the DAO's democratic governance process.
* **Incentive Alignment**: Accepted members receive tokens with some upfront and the rest through a vesting schedule, encouraging long-term participation.
* **Flexible Management**: Applicants can update or withdraw their applications as needed.

### How It Works

1. **Apply for Membership**: Potential members submit their applications, detailing their background, skills, and how they plan to contribute to the DAO.
2. **Community Review**: Existing DAO members review and discuss applications through the governance system.
3. **Decision and Onboarding**:
   * If accepted, the new member starts receiving DAO tokens according to the vesting schedule.
   * If rejected, applicants receive feedback and can improve their application for future consideration.
4. **Ongoing Participation**: As new members receive their tokens over time, they become increasingly invested in the DAO's success.
